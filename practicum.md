**Practicum Rules:**
Each practicum will be completed in groups of three using a single computer. There will be three defined roles as followed:
- **Driver**: This person will be controlling the computer
- **Navigator**: This person will be controlling the driver
- **Data Manager**: This person will be making sure files and projects are being saved in the correct location

During the practicum, roles will switch every 10 minutes. After the class period is over, students will deposit their practicum material into the class shared drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1685AXU4qD1ufpb22JZHlkqSvjdmDylb3?usp=sharing), which will be used to complete the lab.
