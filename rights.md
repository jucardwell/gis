### Your Rights — No Matter Your Citizenship Status

- **You have the right not to open the door** to immigration or law enforcement agents unless they have a valid warrant signed by a judge. Opening the door may be considered consent to enter.

- **You have the right to remain silent.** You do not have to answer questions from immigration agents or police, and anything you say can be used against you.

- **You have the right to speak with a lawyer before signing any documents.** Signing forms without legal advice can affect your rights, including the right to a hearing or to remain in the country.

- **You have the right to ask, “Am I free to leave?”** If the officer says yes, you can calmly walk away. If they say no, you are being detained and have the right to remain silent and request a lawyer.

> “I do not give you permission to enter my home based on my 4th Amendment rights under the United States Constitution unless you have a warrant to enter, signed by a judge or magistrate with my name on it that you slide under the door.”

> “I do not give you permission to search any of my belongings based on my 4th Amendment rights. I choose to exercise my constitutional rights.”
